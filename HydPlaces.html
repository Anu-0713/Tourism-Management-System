 The Charminar is as much the signature of Hyderabad as the Taj Mahal is of Agra or the Eiffel
                                Tower is of Paris. Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of Hyderabad, built Charminar in 1591 at the
                                centre of the original city layout. It was said to be built
                                as a charm to ward off a deadly epidemic raging at that
                                time. Four graceful minarets soar to a height of 48.7m.
                                above the ground. Charminar has 45 prayer spaces and
                                a mosque in it. Visitors can view the architectural
                                splendour inside the Charminar. The monument is illuminated in the evenings and a pedestrianisation
                                project around the monument is under implementation.&nbsp;</font></p>

                                originates from the Telugu words “Golla Konda” meaning
                                “Shepherd’s Hill”. The origins of the fort can be traced
                                back to the Yadava dynasty of Deogiri and the Kakatiyas
                                of Warangal. Golconda was originally a mud fort, which
                                passed to the Bahmani dynasty and later to the Qutb
                                Shahis, who held it from 1518 to 1687 A.D. The first three
                                Qutb Shahi kings rebuilt Golconda, over a span of 62
                                years. The fort is famous for its acoustics, palaces, ingenious
                                water supply system and the famous Fateh Rahben gun,
                                one of the cannons used in the last siege of Golconda
                                by Aurangzeb, to whom the fort ultimately fell.<br>
