 you will find this enthralling waterfall. This beautiful waterfall is the deepest of all the waterfalls in Telangana.
 This is also a caution to people who wish to take a dip in it. The location is very secluded and surrounded by 
picturesque locations and scenic environment. The waterfall has great width and height to make it the deepest in Telangana.
 The fall is 20 meter high and flows down with a great force, and the falls are categorized as plunge waterfalls.
 The holy river Godavari flows through the Sahyadri mountain range and on their way, the river breaks into small streams. 
Some of these streams escape from their path and meet at a point and become the source for the Pochera falls which falls from
 a 20 meters high point. The bed is much deeper and has the capacity to hold a very huge quantity of water.
 We can hear water roaring at a high pitch, exhibiting the power of nature. This place may scare you during night
 with only the moon lighting it up. The waterfall which is extremely beautiful and very scary at the same time is 
one of its kinds in the entire state and is rarely found in the country.</font></p>

The dam’s location in the midst of scenic hillocks and greenery makes it an ideal destination for nature lovers.
 Kadam Dam is also accessible easily to tourists due to its proximity to the Secunderabad-Manmad railway line.
 According to history, the dam is named after a rushi by the name Kandava who had performed great yagnas here,
 while it was officially renamed by the government as Kadam Narayana Reddy Project (KNRP) as a tribute to a popular leader of this region.
 The project serves many mandals through both left and right canals. 
The left canal serves villages like Pedda bellal, Chinna bellal, Chityal, Kondukur, Kannapur, Moriigudem, Patha kondukur, Uppari gudem,
 Chinna camp, Perka palli, and other villages of Kadem mandal. The right canal serves Jannaram, Dandepally, Tallapallli,

 lends a mythical charm for them. One such temple in India is that of Gnana Saraswathi at Basar which holds a prominent place. 
Basar is located on the banks of Godavari River, 34 km from the district headquarters of Nizamabad, very close to Maharashtra
 border in the North Telangana region.This temple is an abode of Goddess Saraswathi, Goddess Lakshmi and Kali considered as
 the Holy Trinity. Legends says that Veda Vyasa, his followers and sage Suka had desired to stay at in a serene environment after 
the Kurukshetra War. Searching for a peaceful abode, they then moved into the Dandakaranya forest and finally chose this place 
owing to peaceful climate. Maharishi Vyasa was known for performing his regular ablutions in the Godavari river. Each day after 
this process he used to get sand in fists and made them into images of Goddess Saraswathi, Lakshmi and Kali by means of his mystic
 power and offered prayers. The place derives its name from Vyasa and called Vasar or Basar (Basara in local dialect).
 It is also considered to be among the three temples created near the holy confluence of the Manjira and Godavari Rivers by the Ashtrakutas.
 A Karnataka king by the name Bijialudu reportedly constructed the current temple at Basar.&nbsp;</font>
